# Linear Algebra Operations
#### version 1.11
Performs various operations on matrices and vectors. Designed for Linear Algebra (college-level, introductory).
Originally made for a friend taking Linear Algebra.

#### Currently Supported Vector Ops:
- Addition/Subtraction
- Dot Product
- Cross Product
- Get Magnitude
- Reduce to Unit Vector

#### Currently Supported Matrix Ops:
- Row-Reduced Echelon Form (RREF)
- Augmented Matrix Solver
- Dimension
- Addition/Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Determinant (2x2 and 3x3 only)

#### Things Coming Soon:
I'll implement these features if I have time in the future.
